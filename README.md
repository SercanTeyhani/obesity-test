# obesity-test
ðŸ©º Obesity Prediction Project
This project aims to predict obesity levels based on individuals' health metrics and lifestyle behaviors. The workflow includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and deployment via a Streamlit web interface.

ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing

Verified dataset integrity and confirmed that the data was balanced across all obesity categories.

Handled categorical values using Label Encoding.

Feature Engineering

Created a new feature: BMI (Body Mass Index) using the formula BMI = Weight / (Height^2), which is a strong indicator of obesity.

Train-Test Split

Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing subsets using train_test_split.

Feature Scaling

Applied StandardScaler to normalize input features, improving model performance.

Model Building: Logistic Regression

Trained a Logistic Regression model using the newton-cg solver and class_weight='balanced' to account for any class imbalances.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated the model using:

Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score)

Log Loss for probabilistic accuracy

Confusion Matrix for class-wise performance

Model Saving

Saved the trained model using joblib for later use in the Streamlit app.

Streamlit Interface

Developed a user-friendly Streamlit web app where users can input relevant personal data and receive obesity level predictions in real time.

ðŸ§° Technologies Used
Python: Data manipulation and modeling

Pandas / NumPy: Data preprocessing

Matplotlib / Seaborn: Visualizations

Scikit-learn: Model building, scaling, evaluation

Joblib: Model persistence
