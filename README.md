# ü©∫ Obesity Prediction Project

This project aims to predict obesity levels based on individuals' health metrics and lifestyle behaviors. The workflow includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and deployment via a Streamlit web interface.

## üìå Project Workflow

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Verified dataset integrity and confirmed that the data was **balanced** across all obesity categories.
- Handled categorical values using **Label Encoding**.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- Created a new feature: **BMI (Body Mass Index)** using the formula `BMI = Weight / (Height^2)`, which is a strong indicator of obesity.

### **3. Train-Test Split**
- Split the dataset into **80% training** and **20% testing** subsets using `train_test_split`.

### **4. Feature Scaling**
- Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize input features, improving model performance.

### **5. Model Building: Logistic Regression**
- Trained a **Logistic Regression** model using:
  - `newton-cg` solver
  - `class_weight='balanced'` to handle any potential class imbalance

### **6. Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated the model using:
  - **Classification Report** (precision, recall, F1-score)
  - **Log Loss** for probabilistic accuracy
  - **Confusion Matrix** for class-wise performance

### **7. Model Saving**
- Saved the trained model using **joblib** for later use in the Streamlit app.

### **8. Streamlit Interface**
- Developed a user-friendly **Streamlit web app** where users can input relevant personal data and receive obesity level predictions in real time.
